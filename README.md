# Pathfinding_Algorithms
Some grid implementation of pathfinding algorithms such as Dijkstra, A* and greedy

This code does not implement a backtracking system, which would be better. Instead it creates a massive list of all paths taken and finds the one that correpsonds to the best one, which is not a good solution.
